# TinyApp Project

TinyApp is a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs (à la bit.ly).
In essence, a URL Shortener is a service that takes a regular URL and transforms it into an encoded version, which redirects back to the original URL. For example:

https://www.lighthouselabs.ca → http://goo.gl/6alQXu
